"""API for handling ".whl" files.

Use :class:`WheelFile` to create or read a wheel.

Managing metadata is done via `metadata`, `wheeldata`, and `record` attributes.
See :class:`MetaData`, :class:`WheelData`, and :class:`WheelRecord` for
documentation of the objects returned by these attributes.

Example
-------
Here's how to create a simple package under a specific directory path::

    with WheelFile('path/to/directory/', mode='w'
                   distname="mywheel", version="1") as wf:
        wf.write('path/to/a/module.py', arcname="mywheel.py")

class MetaData:
    """Implements Wheel Metadata format v2.1.

    Descriptions of parameters based on
    https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/. All parameters
    are keyword only. Attributes of objects of this class follow parameter
    names.

    All parameters except "name" and "version" are optional.

    Note
    ----
    Metadata-Version, the metadata format version specifier, is unchangable.
    Version "2.1" is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Primary identifier for the distribution that uses this metadata. Must
        start and end with a letter or number, and consists only of ASCII
        alphanumerics, hyphen, underscore, and period.

    version
        A string that contains PEP-440 compatible version identifier.

        Can be specified using packaging.version.Version object, or a string,
        where the latter is always converted to the former.

    summary
        A one-line sentence describing this distribution.

    description
        Longer text that describes this distribution in detail. Can be written
        using plaintext, reStructuredText, or Markdown (see
        "description_content_type" parameter below).

        The string given for this field should not include RFC 822 indentation
        followed by a "|" symbol. Newline characters are permitted

    description_content_type
        Defines content format of the text put in the "description" argument.
        The field value should follow the following structure:

            <type/subtype>; charset=<charset>[; <param_name>=<param value> ...]

        Valid type/subtype strings are:
            - text/plain
            - text/x-rst
            - text/markdown

        For charset parameter, the only legal value is UTF-8.

        For text/markdown, parameter "variant=<variant>" specifies variant of
        the markdown used. Currently recognized variants include "GFM" and
        "CommonMark".

        Examples:

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=GFM

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

    keywords
        List of search keywords for this distribution. Optionally a single
        string literal with keywords separated by commas.

        Note: despite the name being a plural noun, the specification defines
        this field as a single-use field. In this implementation however, the
        value of the attribute after instance initialization is a list of
        strings, and conversions to and from string follow the spec - they
        require a comma-separated list.

    classifiers
        List PEP-301 classification values for this distribution, optionally
        followed by a semicolon and an environmental marker.

        Example of a classifier:

            Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows :: Windows 10

    author
        Name and, optionally, contact information of the original author of the
        distribution.

    author_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "author" parameter. Format
        of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header field.

    maintainer
        Name and, optionally, contact information of person currently
        maintaining the project to which this distribution belongs to.

        Omit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    maintainer_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "maintainer" parameter.
        Format of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header
        field.

        Omit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    license
        Text of the license that covers this distribution. If license
        classifier is used, this parameter may be omitted or used to specify the
        particular version of the intended legal text.

    home_page
        URL of the home page for this distribution (project).

    download_url
        URL from which this distribution (in this version) can be downloaded.

    project_urls
        List of URLs with labels for them, in the following format:

            <label>, <url>

        The label must be at most 32 characters.

        Example of an item of this list:

            Repository, https://github.com/MrMino/wheelfile

    platforms
        List of strings that signify supported operating systems. Use only if
        an OS cannot be listed by using a classifier.

    supported_platforms
        In binary distributions list of strings, each defining an operating
        system and a CPU for which the distribution was compiled.

        Semantics of this field aren't formalized by metadata specifications.

    requires_python
        PEP-440 version identifier, that specifies the set Python language
        versions that this distribution is compatible with.

        Some package management tools (most notably pip) use the value of this
        field to filter out installation candidates.

        Example:

            ~=3.5,!=3.5.1,!=3.5.0

    requires_dists
        List of PEP-508 dependency specifiers (think line-split contents of
        requirements.txt).

    requires_externals
        List of system dependencies that this distribution requires.

        Each item is a string with a name of the dependency optionally followed
        by a version (in the same way items in "requires_dists") are specified.

        Each item may end with a semicolon followed by a PEP-496 environment
        markers.

    provides_extras
        List of names of optional features provided by a distribution. Used to
        specify which dependencies should be installed depending on which of
        these optional features are requested.

        For example, if you specified "network" and "ssh" as optional features,
        the following requirement specifier can be used in "requires_externals"
        list to indicate, that the "paramiko" dependency should only be
        installed when "ssh" feature is requested:

            paramiko; extra == "ssh"

        or

            paramiko[ssh]

        If a dependency is required by multiple features, the features can be
        specified in a square brackets, separated by commas:

            ipython[repl, jupyter_kernel]

        Specifying an optional feature without using it in "requires_externals"
        is considered invalid.

        Feature names "tests" and "doc" are reserved in their semantics. They
        can be used for dependencies of automated testing or documentation
        generation.

    provides_dists
        List of names of other distributions contained within this one. Each
        entry must follow the same format that entries in "requires_dists" list
        do.

        Different distributions may use a name that does not correspond to any
        particular project, to indicate a capability to provide a certain
        feature, e.g. "relational_db" may be used to say that a project
        provides relational database capabilities

    obsoletes_dists
        List of names of distributions obsoleted by installing this one,
        indicating that they should not coexist in a single environment with
        this one. Each entry must follow the same format that entries in
        "requires_dists" list do.

        In write and exclusive-write modes, if `file_or_path` is not specified,
        it is assumed to be the current directory. If the specified path is a
        directory, the wheelfile will be created inside it, with filename
        generated using the values given via `distname`, `version`,
        `build_tag`, `language_tag`, `abi_tag`, and `platfrom_tag` arguments.
        Each of these parameters is stored in a read-only property of the same
        name.
        If `file_or_path` is a path to a file, the wheel will be created
        under the specified path.

        If lazy mode is not specified:

            - In read and append modes, the file is validated using validate().
              Contents of metadata files inside .dist-info directory are read
              and converted into their respective object representations (see
              "metadata", "wheeldata", and "record" attributes).
            - In write and exclusive-write modes, object representations for
              each metadata file are created from scratch. They will be written
              to each of their respective .dist-info/ files on close().

        To skip the validation, e.g. if you wish to fix a misformated wheel,
        use lazy mode ('l' - see description of the "mode" parameter).

        In lazy mode, if the opened file does not contain WHEEL, METADATA, or
        RECORD (which is optional as per PEP-627), the attributes corresponding
        to the missing data structures will be set to None.

        If any of the metadata files cannot be read due to a wrong format, they
        are considered missing.

        Filename tags are only inferred if the filename contains 5 or 6
        segments inbetween `'-'` characters. Otherwise, if any tag argument is
        omitted, its attribute is set to an empty string.

        If the archive root contains a directory with a name ending with
        '.dist-info', it is considered to be *the* metadata directory for the
        wheel, even if the given/inferred distname and version do not match its
        name.

        If the archive already contains either one of the aforementioned files,
        they are read, but are not checked for consistency. Use validate() to
        check whether there are errors, and fix() to fix them.

        There are currently 2 classes of errors which completely prevent a well
        formatted zip file from being read by this class:

            - Unknown/incorrect distribution name/version - when the naming
              scheme is violated in a way that prevents inferring these values
              and the user hasn't provided these values, or provided ones that
              do not conform to the specifications. In such case, the scope of
              functioning features of this class would be limited to that of a
              standard ZipFile, and is therefore unsupported.
            - When there are multiple .data or .dist-info directories. This
              would mean that the class would have to guess which are the
              genuine ones - and we refuse the temptation to do that (see "The
              Zen of Python").

        In other words, this class is liberal in what it accepts, but very
        conservative in what it does (A.K.A. the robustness principle).

        Note
        ----
        Despite all of this, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES being made as to whether a
        misformatted file can be read or fixed by this class, and even if it is
        currently, whether it will still be the case in the future versions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_or_path
            Path to the file to open/create or a file-like object to use.

        mode
            See zipfile.ZipFile docs for the list of available modes.

            In the read and append modes, the file given has to contain proper
            PKZIP-formatted data.

            Adding "l" to the mode string turns on the "lazy mode". This
            changes the behavior on initialization (see above), the behavior of
            close() (see its docstring for more info), makes the archive
            modifying methods refrain from refreshing the record & writing it
            to the archive.

            Lazy mode should only be used in cases where a misformatted wheels
            have to be read or fixed.

        distname
            Name of the distribution for this wheelfile.

            If omitted, the name will be inferred from the filename given in
            the path. If a file-like object is given instead of a path, it will
            be inferred from its "name" attribute.

            The class requires this information, as it's used to infer the name
            of the directory in the archive in which metadata should reside.

            This argument should be understood as an override for the values
            calculated from the object given in "file_or_path" argument.  It
            should only be necessary when a file is read from memory or has a
            misformatted name.

            Should be composed of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
            Must not be an empty string.

            See the description of "distname" attribute for more information.

        version
            Version of the distribution in this wheelfile. Follows the same
            semantics as "distname".

            The given value must be compliant with PEP-440 version identifier
            specification.

            See the description of "version" attribute for more information.

        build
            Optional build number specifier for the distribution.

            See `WheelData` docstring for information about semantics of this
            field.

            If lazy mode is not specified, this value must be an integer or a
            string that converts to one. Otherwise no checks for this value are
            performed.

        language_tag
            Language implementation specification. Used to distinguish
            between distributions targetted at different versions of
            interpreters.

            The given value should be in the same form as the ones appearing
            in wheels' filenames.

            Defaults to `'py3'`, but only if an unnamed or a directory target
            was given.

        abi_tag
            In distributions that utilize compiled binaries, specifies the
            version of the ABI that the binaries in the wheel are compatible
            with.

            The given value should be in the same form as the ones appearing
            in wheels' filenames.

            Defaults to `'none'`, but only if an unnamed or a directory target
            was given.

        platform_tag
            Used to specify platforms that the distribution is compatible with.

            The given value should be in the same form as the ones appearing
            in wheels' filenames.

            Defaults to `'any'`, but only if an unnamed or a directory target
            was given.

        compression
            Compression method to use. By default `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED` is
            used.

            See `zipfile.ZipFile` documentation for the full description. This
            argument differs from its `ZipFile` counterpart in that here it is
            keyword-only, and the default value is different.

        allowZip64
            Flag used to indicate whether ZIP64 extensions should be used.

            See `zipfile.ZipFile` documentation for the full description. This
            argument differs from its `ZipFile` counterpart in that here it is
            keyword-only.

        compresslevel
            Compression level to use when writing to the archive.

            See `zipfile.ZipFile` documentation for the full description. This
            argument differs from its `ZipFile` counterpart in that here it is
            keyword-only

        strict_timestamps
            When `True`, files with modification times older than 1980-01-01 or
            newer than 2107-12-31 are allowed. Keyword only.

        Raises
        ------
        UnnamedDistributionError
            Raised if the distname or version cannot be inferred from the
            given arguments.

            E.g. when the path does not contain the version, or the
            file-like object has no "name" attribute to get the filename from,
            and the information wasn't provided via other arguments.

        BadWheelFileError
            Raised if the archive contains multiple '.dist-info' or '.data'
            directories.

        zipfile.BadZipFile
            If given file is not a proper zip.

        """Recreate `wf` using different parameters.

        Creates a new `WheelFile` object using data from another, given as
        `wf`, and given constructor parameters. The new object will contain
        the same files (including those under `.data` and `.dist-info`
        directories), with the same timestamps, compression methods,
        compression levels, access modes, etc., *except*:

        - `.dist-info` directory is renamed, if `version` or `distname` is
          changed.
        - `.data` directory is renamed, if `version` or `distname` is
          changed.
        - `METADATA` will contain almost all the same information, except
          for the fields that were changed via arguments of this method.
        - `WHEEL` will be changed to contain the new `tags` and `build`
          number. The `generator` field will be reset to the one given by
          `WheelData` by default: `"wheelfile <version>"`.
        - `RECORD` is reconstructed in order to accomodate the differences
          above.

        This can be used to rename a wheel, change its metadata, or add files
        to it. It also fixes some common problems of wheel packages, e.g.
        unnormalized dist-info directory names.

        If any of the metadata files is missing or corrupted in `wf`, i.e. the
        properties `metadata`, `wheeldata`, and `record` of `wf` are set to
        `None`, new ones with will be created for the new object, using default
        values.

        All parameters of this method except `wf` are passed to the new
        object's `__init__`.

        For `distname`, `version`, and `*_tag` arguments, if a parameter is not
        given, the value from `wf` is used. If a default is needed instead, set
        the argument to `None` explicitly.

        Even if `wf` was created using a path to a directory, the default value
        used for `file_or_path` will be the current working directory.

        The new `WheelFile` object must be writable, so by default `"w"` mode
        is used, instead of `"r"`. If copying `wf` would result in overwriting
        a file or buffer from which `wf` was created, `ValueError` will be
        raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wf
            `WheelFile` object from which the new object should be recreated.

        mode
            Mode in which the new `WheelFile` should be opened. Accepts the
            same modes as `WheelFile.__init__`, except read mode (`"r"`) is not
            allowed.

        distname, version, build_tag, language_tag, abi_tag, platform_tag
            Optional argument passed to the new object's constructor. See
            `WheelFile.__init__` for the full description. If not specified,
            value from `wf` is used (it is avaialable via property of the same
            name). If `None` is given explicitly, constructor's default is
            used.

        compression, allowZip64, compresslevel, strict_timestamps
            Optional argument passed to the new object's constructor, which in
            turn passes them to `zipfile.ZipFile` - see `zipfile` docs for full
            description on each.

            Value from `wf` is *not* reused for this parameter.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised when:
               - Read mode is used (`"r"`) in `mode`.
               - Creating the object would result in rewriting the underlying
                 buffer of `wf` (if `wf` uses an IO buffer).
               - Creating the object would result in rewriting the file on
                 which `wf` operates.

            Path to the file or directory to add.

        arcname
            Path in the archive to assign the file/directory into. If not
            given, `filename` will be used instead. In both cases, the leading
            path separators and the drive letter (if any) will be removed.

        compress_type
            Same as in `zipfile.ZipFile.write`. Overrides the `compression`
            parameter given to `__init__`.

        compresslevel
            Same as in `zipfile.ZipFile.write`. Overrides the `compresslevel`

        recursive
            Keyword only. When True, if given path leads to a directory, all of
            its contents are going to be added into the archive, including
            contents of its subdirectories.

            If its False, only a directory entry is going to be added, without
            any of its contents.

        resolve
            Keyword only. When True, and no `arcname` is given, the path given
            to `filename` will not be used as the arcname (as is the case with
            `ZipFile.write`), but only the name of the file that it points to
            will be used.

            For example, if you set `filename` to `../some/other/dir/file`,
            `file` entry will be written in the archive root.

            Has no effect when set to False or when `arcname` is given.

        skipdir
            Keyword only. Indicates whether directory entries should be skipped
            in the archive. Set to `True` by default, which means that
            attempting to write an empty directory will be silently omitted.

        recursive
            Keyword only. When True, if given path leads to a directory, all of
            its contents are going to be added into the archive, including
            contents of its subdirectories.

            If its False, only a directory entry is going to be added, without
            any of tis contents.

        resolve
            Keyword only. When True, and no `arcname` is given, the path given
            to `filename` will not be used as the arcname (as is the case with
            `ZipFile.write`), but only the name of the file that it points to
            will be used.

            For example, if you set `filename` to `../some/other/dir/file`,
            `file` entry will be written in the archive root.

            Has no effect when set to False or when `arcname` is given.

        skipdir
            Keyword only. Indicates whether directory entries should be skipped
            in the archive. Set to `True` by default, which means that
            attempting to write an empty directory will be silently omitted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename
            Path to the file or directory to add.

        arcname
            Path in the archive to assign the file/directory into. If not
            given, `filename` will be used instead. In both cases, the leading
            path separators and the drive letter (if any) will be removed.
